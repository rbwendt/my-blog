[FirefoxOS][1] development is really easy if you have experience with front-end web development. Apps are very similar to chrome extensions, with `.manifest` files set up to control the application, and html / css to handle the content and appearance.

With this technology, it's pretty easy to shoehorn a webpage into an app. So if created an HTML app using canvas, as I have done with my [Protect Your Thing][2] game, you can use something like the [FirefoxOS boilerplate app][3] to get yourself up and running quickly. Adding your app to the marketplace is as easy as uploading a zip file and filling out a form. Unlike the Google Play Store, all apps are QA checked before going online, so expect a 12-24 hour delay.

If you have a FirefoxOS device, you can install [Protect Your Thing! for FirefoxOS][4].
