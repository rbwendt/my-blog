I’ve been messing about with blender a bit since the pandemic started. I originally thought I could use it for visualizing data, which is certainly true, but I’ve found more that I’ve been getting in blender-world. I was watching a “coding adevntures” video over the weekend where the author described using fibonacci spheres as a way of evenly distibuting points on a sphere. But I couldn’t find an easy way to do this in blender.

So I made an extension. It’s mostly cobbled together from code snippets I found on-line. You can check it out on [my git hub](https://github.com/rbwendt/blender-add-mesh-fibonacci-sphere).
